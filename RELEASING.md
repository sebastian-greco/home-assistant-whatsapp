# Releasing

The repository contains two independently versioned deliverables:

- the WAHA WhatsApp HACS integration, versioned in `pyproject.toml` and
  `custom_components/waha_whatsapp/manifest.json`;
- the WAHA HAOS app, versioned in `waha/config.yaml` and its Docker build
  argument, then published to GHCR with the same image tag.

Integration releases use `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. App releases use
`waha-vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Never move or reuse a published tag.

Every push to `main` that changes `waha/` builds and publishes the app image.
Pull requests build it without publishing. Bump the app version whenever its
runtime image changes; documentation-only edits do not require a bump.

## Release procedure

1. Update the integration and/or app versions in all matching metadata files.
2. Update the root and/or app changelog.
3. Run the validation commands from `README.md`.
4. Commit and push to `main`, then wait for all validation and image builds.
5. Publish the app tag first when both deliverables changed:

   ```bash
   git tag -a waha-v0.2.0 -m "Release WAHA app 0.2.0"
   git push origin waha-v0.2.0
   ```

6. Publish the HACS integration tag last so it remains GitHub's latest release:

   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release WAHA WhatsApp 1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

The release workflow verifies each tag against the appropriate version file
before creating the GitHub release.
